# Exploring GloVe Embeddings for NLP Tasks

## Description
This project demonstrates how to utilize GloVe (Global Vectors for Word Representation) embeddings to improve the performance of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks. 
By integrating pre-trained GloVe embeddings into a simple neural network model, we aim to showcase the effectiveness of leveraging word embeddings for tasks such as sentiment analysis. 
This example uses TensorFlow and Keras for model building and training, making it accessible to anyone familiar with Python and basic machine learning concepts.
